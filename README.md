# E-Government Citizen Services Portal

## Project Overview
The **E-Government Citizen Services Portal** is a web application designed to allow citizens to access government services online, eliminating the need to visit government offices physically. Services include passport renewal, national ID updates, business licenses, land registration, and more.

This project has three main user sides:
1. **Citizen Side:** For normal users to apply for services.
2. **Officer Side:** For government employees to review and process requests.
3. **Admin Side:** For managers to oversee departments, officers, and generate reports.

The project is built with **Node.js**, **PostgreSQL**, and **EJS** templates. The frontend is simple but clean, using **Bootstrap** or **Tailwind CSS**. Optionally, SPA frameworks (React/Angular/Vue) can be used for enhanced citizen dashboards.

## Main Goals
- Allow citizens to submit requests for government services online.
- Allow officers to review, approve, or reject applications.
